							<h2>My Research</h2>

                        <p>My research has primarily focused on the dynamical evolution of binary star systems. The work of my Master of Research concerned the inspiral of binary stars undergoing common envelope evolution. The work of my PhD focuses on the dynamics of material about forming binary star systems.</p>
                        <p>"Considerations on the role of fall-back discs in the final stages of the common envelope binary interaction" compiled together work done do during my Master of Research concerning the impact that the return of bound material would have on common envelope evolution. Previous simulations of the common envelope phase failed to unbind the envelope of the primary star and reproduce observed separations of post common envelope binaries. We hypothesised that systemed undergoing this evolution might have multiple rebounds of material which would further decrease the binary separation and unbind more material. Here we found that the fall-back of bound material did contributed to further inspiral, but does not significantly unbind more gas. </p>
                        <p><strong>My current research</strong> is focused on the formation of binary star systems and the implications for planet formation around binary stars. My PhD research primarily consistence of ideal MHD simulations with FLASH of binary star formation. I also have an observational component focused on creating a census of the fraction of protoplanetary disks hosted by young binary stars in various star forming regions.</p>
                        <p>The first paper concerns the impact binarity has on the protostellar outflows and launching mechanisms (in peer review process). </p>
                        <p>The second paper will have work about the disruption of protoplanetary disks in forming binary star systems. Here I also introduce turbulence to my simulations (in prep)</p>
